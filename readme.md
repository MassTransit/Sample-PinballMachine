# Sample Pinball Machine

This sample is intended to show how to use Automatonymous standalone, without MassTransit. The sample includes the use of custom activities, transitions, and observers.

The sample is build to use .NET Core App 1.1, so it should work with Rider or other development tools. It was built using Rider on a Mac.

Enjoy!
